# language-8051-assembly package

Syntax highlighting and snippets for 8051 assembly.

This is a package for GitHub's Atom editor.

This package is unlikely to be updated.
Feel free to fork and modify according to your needs if you are trying out 8051 assembly!

Code is **MIT licensed**.

## Installation
If you previously installed the package from which this repo was forked (which is the one listed in the Atom package index), ensure it is uninstalled before installing this version.

Clone this git repository into Atom's packages folder: ```<your user directory>/.atom/packages/```. If you don't have git set up, you can place the folder from the .zip download there instead. Restart Atom. The syntax highlighting should kick in automatically for .asm and .inc files. If it doesn't kick in, manually select the language "8051 Assembly" by clicking on the language setting at the bottom of the window.

## Notes on changes from the forked repository
This fork of language-8051-assembly is set up so as to function similarly to the syntax highlighting in CrossIDE.
It also adds lowercase versions of all snippets. The original uppercase ones remain as well, with a few modifications.
