# language-8051-assembly package

Syntax highlighting and snippets for 8051 assembly.

This is a package for GitHub's Atom editor.

This package was made to make coding in 8051 assembly easier for
a college course. It helped me learn the instruction set and assembly programming.

This package is unlikely to be updated.
Feel free to fork and modify according to your needs if you are trying out 8051 assembly!

Code is **MIT licensed**.

This fork of language-8051-assembly is set up so as to function similarly to the syntax highlighting in CrossIDE.
It also adds lowercase versions of all snippets. The original uppercase ones remain as well, with a few modifications.
